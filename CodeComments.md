# Code Comments
<br/>

Comments can clarify things that the code cannot. Programs have two very different audiences: humans and computers. Compilers and interpreters ignore comments and find all syntactically correct programs equally easy to understand. Human readers may find some programs harder to understand than others, and we look to comments to help us make sense what's going on in the code.
<br/>

Your compiler doesn’t verify the accuracy of your comments so there is no way to determine that the comments included in the program's code are correct. You are, on the other hand, guaranteed that the computer is doing exactly what your code is telling it to.
<br/>

Redundant comments tend to point out <i>what the code does</i>, while useful ones explain <i>why the code exists</i>. A handy rule of thumb is that a comment should only be added to answer a question that the code itself cannot. If you aren’t confused by what a piece of code is doing, but rather why it’s doing it at that moment, then adding a comment would be a great idea.
<br/>

When it comes to code comments, less is more. If you find yourself writing things that sound more like helpful tips rather than succinct explanations, then you might want to consider adding them to your program's documentation instead.
<br/>

Always remember that good comments can’t fix bad code. So, if you come across a portion of code that you truly can’t understand, it might be time to refactor the code rather than adding a multiline explanation.
<br/>

Here are some best practices to follow when writing code comments:

- Comments should not duplicate the code.

- Good comments do not excuse unclear code.

- If you can’t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.

- Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.

- Explain unidiomatic code in comments.

- Provide links to the original source of copied code.

- Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.

- Add comments when fixing bugs.

- Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.
