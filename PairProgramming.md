# Pair Programming
<br/>

Pair programming is a practice in which two developers work together on one task, with one physical machine, in the same development environment. One programmer is the “driver”, and the other programmer is the “navigator”.
<br/>

The driver’s responsible for diligently drafting code, while the navigator’s job is to review what’s being typed and to focus on the plan of action. The fact of the matter is that the pair programming technique can take around 15% longer and yet it yields 15% lesser defects[<sup>1</sup>][1].
<br/>

Pair programming stresses on exchanging information, clarity, response, determination, and consideration. Pair programmers keep each other on task, brainstorm refinements to the system, clarify ideas, take initiative when their partner is stuck, and hold each other accountable.
<br/>

In the most common pair programming style, driver-navigator, each developer has their own monitor, mouse, and keyboard. Each monitor is a mirror of the other. In this way, both developers can sit comfortably, have a full view of the screen, and take or relinquish control as needed. When two developers are working remotely, they can use a tool for remote screen sharing such as the screen sharing feature in Slack.
<br/>

Pair programming is a mutual activity, and it won't be as effective if only one developer is always the driver. Ideally both the team members should periodically trade roles for better results. The driver writes the code while the navigator observes and thinks ahead, asking questions and offering immediate suggestions for improvement. The navigator is essentially doing a real-time code review as the code is being written.
<br/>

Strong-style pairing is the approach in which the driver doesn’t do anything that the navigator did not tell them to. Whenever the driver would like to pitch an idea, the driver must then handover the system to the navigator and then effectively swap positions. This approach completely engages each programmer.
<br/>

In the tour guide style, the driver acts like a tour guide on a bus. The driver does both the strategic thinking and the typing. The other pair member is the "tourist" who passively listens. The tour guide model is useful when one person has much more context than the other, but it's not an ideal long-term arrangement. Even with a significant skill gap between pair programmers, learning by doing is more effective than learning by watching.
<br/>

Ping pong pairing is another pair programming pattern frequently employed by developers. Ping-pong programming works well when combined with test-driven development. In the ping-pong style, one member of the pair writes the test then the other member of the pair writes the code to make the test past. That pair member then writes the next test before passing control back to the other. The pair continues this way throughout the development.
<br/>

The Pomodoro pairing style is like ping-pong pairing, but prescribes set time intervals for each session. A typical Pomodoro-style pairing session lasts 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break. The driver and navigator then switch positions. After four 25-minute sessions, both programmers take a longer 20-minute break. Forced breaks and regular position switching help ensure that both programmers are always productive, focused, and refreshed when a session begins.
<br/>

In tag-team pairing, the driver and navigator switch positions but don't follow set time intervals or rules for when the switching can occur. Basically, the switch can occur when the driver is tired, when the navigator wants a chance to take the lead, or for any other reason given by either programmer.
<br/>

Pair programming can improve overall productivity and software quality through the process of collaboration. The practice of pair programming yields many benefits such as:

- Higher quality code because of real-time review.

- Better designed solutions through shared collaboration.

- Better distribution of knowledge of the code within your team so that it isn’t just one single developer that understands a particular portion of the code.

- Greater job satisfaction for the developers who enjoy the high productivity and social aspect of pairing.

- Faster delivery because solutions to challenging problems are found quicker.

- Consistent coding practices through collaboration.

- Greater focus on the code and programming task without distractions.
